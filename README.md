# Push_swap

# 📋 Description

**Push_swap** is a sorting algorithm project that sorts data on a stack using a limited set of instructions with the lowest possible number of actions.

The program takes a list of integers as input and outputs a sequence of operations that sorts the stack in **ascending order**.

The challenge lies in sorting the numbers efficiently using only **two stacks** (`stack a` and `stack b`) and the following restricted operations:

```
sa, sb, ss    -> Swap operations
pa, pb        -> Push operations
ra, rb, rr    -> Rotate operations
rra, rrb, rrr -> Reverse rotate operations
```

The project demonstrates understanding of:

* Algorithm complexity
* Data structures
* Optimization techniques
* Low-level program design

# 🧮 Algorithms Implemented

## 1️⃣ Simple Algorithm — O(n²) — Bubble Sort

### Implementation

The **bubble sort** algorithm repeatedly steps through the stack, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
This process continues until the stack is fully sorted.

### Justification

This algorithm serves as a **baseline implementation**.

It is:

* Easy to implement
* Easy to understand
* Suitable for **very small stacks (≤5 elements)**

The quadratic complexity is acceptable for such small inputs and avoids the overhead of more complex algorithms.

---

## 2️⃣ Medium Algorithm — O(n√n) — Block-Based Sort

### Implementation

The stack is divided into **√n sized chunks** based on element indices.

Steps:

1. Elements are pushed to **stack b** chunk by chunk.
2. After all chunks are transferred, elements are returned to **stack a**.
3. The algorithm always moves the **maximum element in stack b to the top** before pushing it back.

### Justification

This approach:

* Reduces the number of operations compared to O(n²)
* Keeps implementation complexity reasonable
* Works well for **medium sized stacks (6–100 elements)**

---

## 3️⃣ Complex Algorithm — O(n log n) — Heap Sort Adaptation

### Implementation

This algorithm simulates a **heap-like selection strategy**:

1. Find the **maximum element in stack a**
2. Rotate stack `a` until the element reaches the top
3. Push it to **stack b**
4. Repeat until stack `a` is empty
5. Push all elements back from **b → a**

Occasional swaps are used to maintain correct order.

### Justification

In the push_swap model, **operation count** is the main cost.

This approach:

* Reduces total operations
* Performs well for **large inputs (100+ elements)**

---

## 4️⃣ Adaptive Algorithm — Disorder-Based Strategy

### Implementation

The algorithm first calculates a **disorder metric** of the stack:

```
0   = already sorted
1   = reverse sorted
```

Based on this metric, the program automatically selects the best strategy.

| Disorder Level | Algorithm Used       | Complexity |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ---------- |
| < 0.2          | Bubble Sort          | O(n²)      |
| 0.2 – 0.5      | Block-Based Sort     | O(n√n)     |
| ≥ 0.5          | Heap Sort Adaptation | O(n log n) |

### Justification

No single algorithm performs optimally for every input.

Adaptive selection allows:

* Faster sorting for **nearly sorted stacks**
* Better performance for **highly disordered stacks**
* Improved **average-case efficiency**
